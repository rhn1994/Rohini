2. Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, 
so the value of len('Cigna') is 5. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter 
and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.

x= len('Cigna')#returns no of characters as'5'
def right_justify(s)
string_length=len(s)+70 
string_revised=s.rjust(string_length)
print(string_revised)

right_justify('cigna')
